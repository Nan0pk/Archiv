# Known issues

## Diagnostics export

- Schema `1` reports aggregate counts, not which document failed. This is intentional;
  support should suggest general recovery steps without requesting private source data.
- Platform and package versions may fingerprint an unusual installation, and aggregate
  counts disclose approximate library activity. Review the complete preview before saving.
- A destination must be a new file; the exporter refuses to overwrite an existing file.
- Database corruption is represented only as `unreadable`; raw SQLite errors are withheld.

General alpha limitations remain documented in [Offline alpha](offline-alpha.md) and the
[format compatibility matrix](format-compatibility.json).
